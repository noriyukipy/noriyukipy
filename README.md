Chatbot changes the world!😄

I am interested in conversational AI💬 (e.g. open-domain chatbot, FAQ chatbot). I am especially interested in open-domain chatbot based on language generation models.

### 🤖 What I created

- [GPTChat](https://github.com/noriyukipy/gptchat) - Training/generation CLI with GPT-2 based language and conversational model
- [msgFlow](https://github.com/noriyukipy/msgflow) - Simple chatbot framework in Python. Easy to configure with YAML and connect to several services. Get started from the [document](https://noriyukipy.github.io/msgflow/)
